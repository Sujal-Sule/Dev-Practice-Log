# Daily Web Development Practice 🚧

This repository is my personal **build log** — a place where ideas turn into code,
mistakes turn into lessons, and small experiments slowly compound into real skills.

I’m starting from the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and deliberately
working my way toward full-stack MERN development — one commit at a time.

Nothing here is random.
Everything here is practice.

## Tech Stack (Evolving)
- HTML — structure before style
- CSS — layout, motion, and visual thinking
- JavaScript — logic, behavior, and control
- React — coming soon
- Node.js & Express — coming soon
- MongoDB — coming soon

## Why this repo exists
- To stay consistent, not perfect
- To document progress, not hide mistakes
- To strengthen fundamentals before chasing frameworks
- To experiment freely without “production pressure”

This is where I **learn in public**.

> This repository is a workshop, not a showroom.
> Expect experiments, rough edges, and growth.
