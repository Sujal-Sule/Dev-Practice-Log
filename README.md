# Daily Web Development Practice

A quiet place to think in code.

This repository is my design-driven practice space — where structure,
layout, motion, and interaction are explored through small, focused builds.

I’m starting with the fundamentals and moving deliberately toward
full-stack MERN development, prioritizing **clarity over speed** and
**craft over noise**.

## Stack (In Progress)
- HTML — semantic structure
- CSS — layout, spacing, motion
- JavaScript — interaction & behavior
- React — upcoming
- Node.js / Express — upcoming
- MongoDB — upcoming

## Philosophy
- Design before decoration
- Fundamentals before frameworks
- Progress over polish
- Fewer projects, better thinking

This is not a portfolio.
This is where the portfolio is born.
